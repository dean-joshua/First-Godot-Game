# Overview

This is simple survival game. You spawn as a block in the middle of the screen and have to survive the wave of zombies by avoiding them.
If a zombie hits you the game ends. I created this software with the intent to learn more about Godot and its game development capabilities.
The game is played with the directional keys on the users keyboard.
